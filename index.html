          <h1 class="Meal-Planner-heading">The Calorie and Macro Meal Planner</h1>
          <p class="Meal-Planner-para"> Enter your personalized nutrition targets and let our meal planner find the recipes to match. The grocery list will be generated automatically and you can download your meal plan to PDF. If you are unsure what your nutritional targets should be just allow the calorie and macro calculator to calculate it for you. It’s proven, highly effective and makes personalized meal planning much easier..</p>
          <h2>Meal Plan Generator</h2>
          <p class="Meal-Planner-para">Ordinary calorie counter/tracker apps can be helpful in understanding the amount of calories found in your food but the process of constantly having to come up with recipe ideas and adjusting ingredient qualities to match your calories and macros can be exhausting. Our meal plan generator finds all the recipes to match your daily nutritional needs automatically- much easier!

            You can still include your own recipes in the meal planner though. Add your own recipes and we will calculate the nutritional values automatically, just like a regular calorie tracker. You can then enter your own recipe into your meal plan and press the “lock” function to keep it in place. Once you do this you can then ask the meal planner to find meals to complete the rest of your day and still hit your macros and calorie targets.
            
            If the planner returns a recipe that isn’t quite to your taste you can press the swap button to find a list of suitable alternatives.
            
            This is a meal planner for one so you won’t have to keep dividing up the ingredient amounts when a recipe is made for 6 servings. If you do occasionally cook for more than one person you can adjust the serving size of a recipe in the grocery list section to quickly do the maths for you.
            
            Once you have finished creating a weekly meal plan make sure to download your plan to PDF and stick it to your fridge to keep you on track!</p>
            <h2>Calorie and Macro Calculator</h2>
            <p class="Meal-Planner-para">Are you unsure what your calorie and macro targets should be? When you create a plan make sure to select the “Build a plan for me” option and we will calculate personalized targets based on your personal statistics and your goal whether it is weight loss, healthy living/maintenance, or for building muscle/bodybuilding.

              Our calculator is the only one to calculate a set of minimum and maximum ranges as opposed to just one specific number for calories and macronutrients. This allows you to have more flexibility in your diet and encourages you to have a healthy relationship with food. And of course, this approach is also proven to work!</p>
